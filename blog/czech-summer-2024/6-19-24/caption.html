    This week balanced intense activities with much-needed rest. We organized camp materials, participated in outreach events, and visited schools. Highlights included an ultimate frisbee outreach and an inspiring trip to Pardubice. After busy days, I found rest and time to reflect on God&#x2019;s care and promises. As we prepare for the first short-term missionaries, I&#x2019;m grateful for the support and encouragement from God and others.
