    My first week of the internship in the Czech Republic has been both challenging and rewarding. After arriving in Prague, we immediately started the Josiah Venture Amazing Race, which involved running around the country, completing challenges, and working as a team. It was exhausting, but my team placed second. The following days were spent in intern training, which was incredibly encouraging. We had lessons on various spiritual topics and connected with people from different cultures. I am now in Ostrava, and will be here for three weeks before camps start, doing school visits and various other activites to serve the missionaries here.
