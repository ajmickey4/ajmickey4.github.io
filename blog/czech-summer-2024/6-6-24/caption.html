    In two weeks, I'm off to the Czech Republic for a 10-week internship with Josiah Venture. Despite mixed emotions about leaving home, I'm excited to follow Jesus and surrender my will. As an introvert, stepping out of my comfort zone is a big surrender to God's call. Reflecting on past missionary biographies, I'm amazed at how God has transformed my heart. I'm praying for a compassionate heart like Jesus and a faithful commitment to His mission. Grateful for the support, I'll be sharing updates and prayer requests in a blog series throughout the summer.
