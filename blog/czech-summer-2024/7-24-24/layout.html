title: Second Camp Down!

    In all honesty, this past camp was difficult for me. I was very tired and very homesick, and the camp was quite different from the ones I had done previously. I felt like I had a difficult time connecting with students and overall having a joyful attitude and showing the love of Christ. Yet continually,  in turning to God this week, I was able to find His joy and peace whenever I stepped into time with students and God did amazing things. Although I felt I didn&#x2019;t do much and struggled to build connection God was at work. One of the girls in my discussion group decided to start following Jesus this week! And one particular student I got to talk a lot with was very very sad to say goodbye at the train station. While he was already a believer, it was an amazing week of encouraging him to step into ministry God calls him into and also him encouraging and inspiring me to trust the Lord more deeply. This camp had a great group of kids and I feel blessed to have spent time with them and show them Jesus in any way. Praise God!
    <br /><br />Sorry for the shorter update these past weeks have been busy and crazy!

    <strong>Prayer Requests:</strong>
    <br /><br /> - For me to have the energy and love for students and faith in God to get through this final camp.
    <br /><br /> - Students who decided to follow Jesus ore get more involved with their faith would find community where they live and grow.
    <br /><br /> - Students at this upcoming camp would have soft hearts be ready to hear and respond to the gospel and that many would be saved and experience Jesus&#x2019; perfect love.
