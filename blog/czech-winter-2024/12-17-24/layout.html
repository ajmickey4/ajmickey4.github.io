    It&#x2019;s already that time again! I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s already been a semester and I&#x2019;m about to head out to the Czech Republic again. My team leaves tomorrow and I&#x2019;m so excited to be a part of our winter camp this year. Unlike my previous visit to the Czech Republic, this trip is not associated with Josiah Venture but is instead just a partnership between my church (Family Bible Church) and CB &#x010C;esk&#x00FD; T&#x011B;&#x0161;&#x00ED;n.

    On this trip, we are going to have a Christmas themed English minicamp for students focusing on what Christmas is really about; Jesus! As our trip also overlaps with Christmas this year, we will be hosting an American Christmas party on the 25th so that students can see what Christmas is like in America. Something a little different about the Czech Republic is that they celebrate Christmas on the 24th (Christmas Eve) even though Christmas is still the 25th.
    <br /><br />Winter camp 2023 last year was an absolute blast and was an amazing time to build some deeper connections with students I had met that summer. I also got to see how God had changed, and grown me from the summer, and it was really encouraging. Winter camp is lower energy, and a closer group than summer camp and I find this really peaceful. Which funnily enough is the theme of this years&#x2019; camp: Peace On Earth. While I look forward to many things being carried over from last year and continuing on from summer camp, there are also going to be many things that are different. On the past trips I had been on the younger side of the team, and I had older friends that had more experience than I did which was an encouragement to me. But this year, all of those people won&#x2019;t be at camp, and I I&#x2019;ve had to step up into more responsibilities and have to prepare to do camp without them. Additionally, my school overlaps with the trip and I will have to take a final online in the Czech Republic before camp. All of this can draw my focus away from what God wants for this trip and can busy my mind.

    Luckily, I am reminded that the baby Jesus was born to be the &#x201C;Prince of Peace&#x201D; &#x2013; Isaiah 9:6. God is greater than all the things rushing through my mind all the things that need to come together from my point of view to make this camp great. He is greater than even my emotions and is a source of peace always.

    I love this time of year because so many of the special songs we sing are about God&#x2019;s love for us and what Jesus truly did on Christmas. As I have prepped music for this years&#x2019; camp, I have been able to look more closely at the lyrics of many Christmas Carols and I love how our Savior is honored and glorified in them. I would particularly suggest looking through the words of Hark the Heral Angels sing. It has very powerful words.

    <br /><br /><strong>Prayer Requests:</strong>
    <br /><br />- Safe travels
    <br /><br />- Working out taking a final in the Czech Republic
    <br /><br />- Peace for our Team
    <br /><br />- God to do the work and reveal himself and his love to the students, the Czech leaders and church, and our team.
